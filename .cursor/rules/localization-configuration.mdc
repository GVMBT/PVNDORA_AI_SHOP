# Localization & Configuration Rules

## Strict Separation of Concerns

NEVER call bot.set_my_commands, bot.set_my_description, or bot.set_my_name inside the Vercel request handler (api/index.py).

THESE METHODS MUST be placed in a separate local script: scripts/setup_bot.py.

Native Telegram Localization (Zero-State):

Use aiogram.methods.SetMyDescription and SetMyName with the language_code parameter.

Define translations in bot_setup/bot_info.json containing translations for all 9 languages (en, ru, de, es, etc.) for:

name: (appears in chat list)

short_description: (appears in shared link preview)

description: (appears before user clicks Start)

The scripts/setup_bot.py must iterate through this dictionary and apply settings to Telegram API asynchronously.

Runtime Localization (Dynamic):

Inside api/index.py:

Extract user_language = update.message.from_user.language_code.

Pass this code to the Gemini System Prompt context.

DO NOT use older gettext or .po files. Rely on LLM's native ability to generate multilingual text based on the system prompt instruction: "You are speaking with a user in {user_language}."
